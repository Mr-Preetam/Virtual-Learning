  <p><i class="fas fa-quote-left" style="color: cyan;"></i>   A<span class="fw-bold"> Virtual Learning Environment</span> (VLE) is a system for delivering learning materials to students via the web. These systems include assessment, student tracking, collaboration and communication tools. They can be accessed both on and off-campus, meaning that they can support students' learning outside the lecture hall 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This enables institutions to teach not only traditional full-time students but also those who cannot regularly visit the campus due to geographic or time restrictions, e.g. those on distance learning courses, doing evening classes, or workers studying part-time.

  There are different types of VLE, which all work slightly differently but ultimately perform the same function and can deliver the same learning materials.   <i class="fas fa-quote-right" style="color: cyan;"></i></p>
